DBD-TSM version 0.05
====================

DBD::TSM is a pure perl module. It needs to locate the TSM command below:

   dsmadmc
   
It works with default install directory and file name for :
- AIX
- Linux
- Windows
- Darwin (not tested by me)

However, if you set TSM environment variable :
- DSM_DIR : directory where to find command
- DSM_CONFIG : TSM config file
I use it.

Try to set also DSM_LOG not to log in your current directory and exist some
issue with rights with TSM 5.3+.

To run my test successfully you need to:
- Have a TSM server started
- A TSM Client full operationnal. i.e.:
  * TSM Binary installed (dsmadmc is the most important in that case)
  * dsm.sys or/and dsm.opt set to work with your tsm server.
    o Check it before with a manual test with:
      dsmc query session command
    o Check it before with a manual test with:
      dsmadmc -id=<user> -pa=<password> -se=<Your Server Name stanza> query status
- Use standard DBI environment variable (exported):
   DBI_DSN=dbi:TSM:<your server name>
   DBI_USER=<your tsm user>
   DBI_PASS=<your tsm password>

I add new tests that use an emulation of 'dsmadmc'.

For instance (under UNIX for sh like shell):

DBI_DSN=dbi:TSM:MYSERVER
DBI_USER=admin
DBI_PASSWORD=admin

export DBI_DSN
export DBI_USER
export DBI_PASSWORD

If you achieve all these steps, I think all will working...
